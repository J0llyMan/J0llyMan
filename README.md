# 👋 Hi, I'm J0llyMan

I'm an **Accounting & Finance graduate pivoting into IT and Cybersecurity**.  
Currently, I’m working toward my **CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications**, building hands-on labs, and documenting my learning process along the way.  

I have developed a strong foundation in **Networking**, **Defensive Security**, and **Offensive Security**, and have completed **DevSecOps** training to understand secure software development practices.
